# This configuration defines how two URLs are considered equal. There are
# Tokens, Inquisitors, and Processors. Tokens of a URL are simple strings
# inherent in the URL itself (the scheme, the port number, the domain, the
# path, etc.). Inquisitors are more expensive attributes that require performing
# a lookup (a dns record, an HTTP response code, an HTTP location header, etc.).
# Processors are mutations on Tokens that change their encoding (URL-encode,
# Base64-encode).
# For a URL to be determined a duplicate, all declared Tokens, Inquisitors, and Processors
# must match (i.e., following boolean AND logic).


# Available simple tokens. Consider the example URL:  https://user:pass@host.com:1234/path?param1=xx&param2=yy#ff
#   scheme          https
#   username        user
#   password        pass
#   domain          host.com
#   port            1234
#   path            /path
#   queryparams     param1=xx&param2=yy
#   fragment        ff


# Available inquisitors
#   dnsa          If any A record matches any A record of another input, consider them duplicates
#   dnscname      Compares the CNAME record. Performs DNS queries using OS system libraries.
#   statuscode    Compares the HTTP response status code
#   contentlength Compares the HTTP response body content length (not the response header value, but the actual calculated length)
#   contenthash   Compares the MD5 checksum of the response body.
#   contentregex  Compares whether a provided regular expression is matched in the response body.
#   headerregex   (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Compares whether a provided regular expression is matched in the response header.
#   title         (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Compares the page title from the HTTP body
#   location      (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Compares the HTTP response Location header value
#   wordcount     (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Compares the count of words observed in the HTTP response body
#   linecount     (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Compares the count of lines observed in the HTTP response body


# Available processors: these tokens alter the input string, and see if the altered string is found elsewhere in the input list.
#   urlencode     (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
#   base64encode  (NOT IMPLEMENTED)


# This file contains one ruleset, which contains the named rule "default", and the named rule "simple".
# Every token, inquisitor, and processor for a single rule must match in order for two URLs to be
# considered duplicate. This matching logic is performed for each named rule. If a pair of URLs are
# determined equivalent based on the named rule "simple", it is removed (even if the URL is not determined
# equivalent based on the named rule "default"). Put in other words, if *any* named rule identifies a
# pair of URLs as equivalent, then that URL is classified as a duplicate and discarded.
